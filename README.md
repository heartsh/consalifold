# NeoAliFold Program, Program for Maximum-expected-accuracy Estimations of RNA Consensus Secondary Structures 
This project provides the NeoAliFold Program, a program for the maximum-expected-accuracy estimations of RNA consensus secondary structures.

# Installation
This project has been written in mainly Rust, a systems programming language.
So first, you need to install the Rust compiler, package manager, and standard library. 
Visit [the Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org) to see more about this language.
You can install these 3 components with 1 line as follows:
```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
The above installation is done by [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs), so you can easily switch a compiler to use. 
Now you can install the NeoAliFold program as follows: 
```bash
$ cargo install neoalifold
```
Check if this program has been installed properly as follows:
```bash
$ neoalifold
```
